Description: R wrapper for Zerodha Kite Connect API (version 3), with most
    functionalities exposed. This package is intended to serve as a lower level
    utility on top of which applications can be build. For example this package
    does not handle user input validation for most functions, and raises R-style
    exceptions instead.
