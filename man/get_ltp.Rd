\description{
Function to obtain last traded prices.
}
\details{
This function accepts a list of instruments (as exchange:symbol
pair, e.g. NFO:NIFTY18JANFUT) and returns last traded prices. Please note:
this function is meant to be called as a one-off way to get the quotes.
One should not call this function too many times. The api possibly has a
rate limit and too many requests will block the user. For continous data,
websocket is more appropriate choice. Check the Kite Connect online
documentation for more details.
